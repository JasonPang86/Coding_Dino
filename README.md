# HYLHackathonT5
Team 5 for HYL Hackathon 2022

We created an interactive way for Children and Adults to learn about different coding language features and study them,
You start off as a red dinosaur in a middle of a forest that you've never heard about, and continue on your path towards fighting all the 
current reigning kings in order to roam the new forest that you like freely and without danger.
Each other dinosaur will ask you a question and you must answer 2 correctly in order to move onto the next one!

Your friend Maurice (Small Yellow Dinosaur) will give you additionally help when you press SPACEBAR near him and will explain what to do!


HOW TO RUN:
  - Copy the GitHUB Repository into your own computer,
  - CD into the correct folder and make sure your assets are working properly
  - Once there, navigate to the menu.py file and compile it and run!
  - You now can choose between 4 Different Languages to practice and help Mort free himself from the other Dinosaurs!
  - Once in game, move around with WASD and interact with Maurice using Spacebar.
  - When in a fight with a bigger dinosaur, you have to guess 2 correct in order to beat him! Guess using your number keys!
